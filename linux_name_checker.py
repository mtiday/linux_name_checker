''' file name checker for Windows

This program crawls through a directory and lets you know if there are
names that will be considered duplicates in Windows. i.e. two folders named
example and Example in Linux would be the same folder in Windows. Therefore
if you copied this directory from Linux to Windows not everything would
copy. I have had issues with SpiderOak backing up files from Linux to Windows
and visa-versa.
